/**
 * Loading placeholder: a highlight band sweeping across a surface tile. Sized
 * and shaped entirely by the caller's [modifier] — clip it to match whatever it
 * stands in for, so the skeleton occupies the exact frame the real content will.
 *
 * The sweep travels two widths so the band clears the frame completely before
 * restarting; a one-width travel makes it reappear the instant it exits, which
 * reads as a stutter rather than a pulse.
 *
 * Note for tests: this is an infinite animation, so Compose never reports idle
 * while one is on screen. Compose UI tests that can see a skeleton must drive
 * the clock manually (`mainClock.autoAdvance = false`) instead of awaiting idle.
