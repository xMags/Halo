/**
 * The app's icons, held as the raw 24dp path data from Google's Material Icons
 * (Apache-2.0) rather than taken as a dependency. The published icon artifacts
 * are either the ~2000-icon extended set or a Compose Multiplatform build that
 * stopped several versions behind the one this app uses; a handful of glyphs
 * does not justify either.
 *
 * The strings are the source files' path data verbatim, handed to Compose's own
 * [PathParser] — nothing is transcribed into the vector-builder DSL by hand, so
 * there is no step where a glyph can be silently mangled. Each source file also
 * carries a full-bounds rectangle ("M0 0h24v24H0z") as a `fill="none"` spacer;
 * those are dropped, since an ImageVector would paint them as a solid tile.
 *
 * Fill is opaque white only because it must be something: `Icon` replaces it
 * with its own tint.
