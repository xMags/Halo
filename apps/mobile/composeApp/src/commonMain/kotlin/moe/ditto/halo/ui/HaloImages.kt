/**
 * The app's image loader. Poster and backdrop art comes from addon-supplied
 * public CDN URLs, so this deliberately lets the Ktor fetcher build its own
 * HTTP client rather than sharing the authenticated Halo API client — a session
 * token must never ride along to a third-party CDN.
 *
 * Caches are sized explicitly instead of using a percentage of app memory: the
 * budget is easier to reason about when the payload is known. A poster at the
 * largest layout size renders around 500x750 px, i.e. ~1.5 MB decoded, so the
 * memory cache holds roughly forty of them and a catalog screen's worth of
 * scrollback survives a tab switch.

/**
 * Remote art that loads behind a skeleton and crossfades in.
 *
 * The image sits underneath at full opacity and the skeleton fades out over it,
 * rather than the image fading in over the skeleton. Fading both at once would
 * leave a window where neither is opaque and the page background shows through
 * the middle of a poster.
 *
 * The fade is driven here rather than by Coil's own crossfade transition,
 * because the two would compose into that same muddy double-fade. Loading from
 * the memory cache resolves before the first frame, so a warm poster settles at
 * a fully faded placeholder and never flashes a skeleton.
 *
 * A failed load settles the same way a successful one does, landing on the bare
 * surface tile: a missing poster reads as an empty slot in the grid rather than
 * a frame that shimmers forever.
 *
 * Callers own the shape — clip in the passed [modifier] and the fill clips too.
